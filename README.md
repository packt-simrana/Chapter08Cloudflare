# SvelteKit-Up-and-Running
Welcome to the code repository for the book SvelteKit Up and Running! This repository aims to function as a reference so readers of the book may see the examples as they are written throughout the book.


## Layout
This repository is broken up into two main folder. The first is the chapters/ directory where code samples for each chapter appear just as they do throughout the book. Of course, each chapter is organized into its own directory to simplify navigation. If you are following along with the book and would like to copy snippets instead of typing it out on your own, it is recommended to grab code from the appropriate file in each chapter.

The second directory of note is full_project/. This directory contains the entire project as it is built throughout the book. It should reflect the very last state of the project and so may not look exactly as the code does in earlier chapters of the book. If you have finished reading the book and are simply interested in playing with the concepts learned throughout the book, then this is the recommended playground.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository into your preferred directory. Once done, you can browse files or install the full project by navigating to full_project/ and running `npm install` followed by `npm run dev` to start the application.
